# Restricted Boltzmann Machine + Extreme Learning Machine (RBM-ELM)

This repository contains the implementation for the [RBM-ELM](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417308102). You can run it using NumPy or TensorFlow.
In addition, you're gonna need to also clone the [ELM](https://github.com/paaatcha/ELM) and [RBM](https://github.com/paaatcha/RBM) repositories.

You'll also need to load your dataset. The comments in the code will guide you.

If you find any bug or have any question about the method, just let me know.


## Dependecies:
* Python 2.7.x
* NumPy
* Tensorflow <= 1.9 (if you wanna use it)
* Scikit-learn
* RBM (check my [RBM](https://github.com/paaatcha/RBM) repository)
* ELM (check my [RBM](https://github.com/paaatcha/ELM) repository)
